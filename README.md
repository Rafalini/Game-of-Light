### Usage:

Draw shape (different shapes will appear sequentially, one by one) by clicking and dragging in black area. Move lightsource with 'W'A'S'D' or arrows and enjoy casting shadows of figures on each other or boundaries :)


### Run:

compile (using javac 11.0.5-ea or newer) and run with:

$: javac Main.java 

$: java Main


### Notes:

Polygon shapes are generated with random number of  sides (from 1 - just wall as well as 2, to 8), except circle and rectangle.


* choice of figures in menu (not sequential change after drawing) in future update

* jar file in the future
